### H1 - Decoding 8086 instructions (mov)
We start with decoding 8086 instructions. 
First homework assignment is to decode mov instructions from listing 37 and listing 38.
### H2 - More mov instructions
More complicated mov instructions.
### H3 - Arithmetic instruction
Instructions similar to Mov, find common patterns
### H4 - Simulating Mov
Extend the debugger into simulator.
My decoder was not good enough for this task. Using Casey's library for now, will extend by debugger later.
